         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Firſt, with great comfort and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of heart, they did think much of that moſt merciful gift of Chriſt to his Church, the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with no leſs cheerfulneſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement did they conſider, That the Lord Jeſus in expreſs words bids them whenever they pray, to ſay that Prayer; <hi>When ye pray,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. Thereby plainly teaching them, that it was by him intended for all times, occaſions, and purpoſes whatſoever. And being there is nothing neceſſary either for Soul or body, either for this, or for the life to come, but therein couched it is and comprehended and meant, and underſtood by God the compoſer and hearer of the Prayer; though not by us perhaps the offerers. In devout aſking of all the bleſſings, and of the whole matter of this Prayer, not according to their own weak and low underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, but according to Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in it, and his moſt gracious and fatherly intention towards Mankind by it: I ſay, in devout leiſurely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94764:7"/>putting up this Prayer unto God, they did aſſure themſelves, they prayed moſt worthily and acceptedly for Friends, for Enemies, for Children, for Parents, for Maſters, for Servants, for King, for Church, for State, for Prieſt, for Neighbours, for Paſtors, for Guide, for any ſick, or otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed. If all the while they offered up this Prayer upon this or that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all along they thought moſt wiſtly and affectionately of him, her, it, or them, that they then meant good to. Nay they then aſſured themſelves, they had prayed for him, her, it, or them, as to the hearer of Prayers was accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo to the perſon or perſons, or body prayed for, effectual or beneficial one way or other. In the third and laſt place, whereas ſome perhaps may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſay, that underſtand they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, how any mans Faith, Repentance, or Religiouſneſs can benefit another, nor can they call to mind that ever they knew their Prayer for any elſe had ever the deſired effect and event. This rub they were taught to put out of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94764:7"/>way by theſe five Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is indeed no ſenſe nor reaſon at all that any mans Religiouſneſs or Devotion ſhould in the leaſt benefit any beſides himſelf; no, <hi>nor himſelf neither;</hi> but only that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>that it ſhall.</hi> Here, here is all the power and energy of Prayer; God hath commanded it for others, as well as for our ſelves, and in ſix hundred places hath promiſed to be overcome by it, <hi>at ſuch time,</hi> and in <hi>ſuch ways,</hi> as he ſees moſt fit and neceſſary. So not the Prayers themſelves, but Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that upon our Prayers he will do ſo and ſo, <hi>This is the All in All.</hi> But if thoſe ſix hundred Promiſes were not in Scripture ſo <hi>expreſs,</hi> yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for praying for others, being <hi>moſt</hi> expreſs, it were enough: Becauſe as every promiſe almoſt does ſuppoſe a command, ſo alſo does every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand imply a promiſe; this command for inſtance, for Interceſſion, <hi>that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail it ſhall;</hi> for God never commands frivolous, fruitleſs and ſucceſsleſs things.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As to the event and real effect
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94764:8"/>of Prayers, the Word they were taught, informs us to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Creature is to do his duty, and to leave the iſſue to God, the event being Gods care and buſineſs, not the Creatures, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.26, 27. <hi>So is the Kingdom of God, as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up he knows not how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That the event is always that which is <hi>beſt,</hi> though <hi>not that</hi> which the Votary did particularly aim at. As when <hi>Saul</hi> ſought for nothing but his Fathers Aſſes, but met, we know, with the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>Abrahams</hi> Prayer for all <hi>Sodom</hi> is anſwered by the ſignal deliverance of his neer kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Lot;</hi> for ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>And it came to paſs when God deſtroyed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Plain, that God remembred Abraham, and ſent Lot out of the midſt of the overthrow, when he overthrew the Cities, in the which Lot dwelt,</hi> Gen. 19.29. Nay, <hi>omnibus poſitis,</hi> the world being as it <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is,</hi> nothing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94764:8"/>
                  <hi>could be, can</hi> be, better than it <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is.</hi> Beſides, they that wait upon God in his ways, eſpecially that of praying for others as well as for themſelves; theſe do always find all events, good unto them and to the univerſe, one way or other; for to ſuch, the Lord who made Heaven and Earth, and rules all, makes all events to be bleſſings out of Sion, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134.3. That is, to be not only <hi>Secular</hi> events, but alſo Sion-bleſſings; or ſuch as he uſes to ſanctifie to his Church, to Sion and all praying Believers; and likewiſe to enable them to be well contented with them, be they never ſo harſh and diſtaſtful to fleſh and blood; yet ſtill ſomething of comfort and ſatisfaction do they, <hi>by vertue of their walking in the ways of Sion,</hi> ſind and deprehend in them; according to that moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and moſt common word of the believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when any thing very croſs fell out <hi>to</hi> or <hi>upon</hi> them, <hi>Gam zu le tobha,</hi> would they ſay, <hi>Even this for good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the unerring eye of Providence,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94764:9"/>or <hi>Omnividence,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>ſaw,</hi> and <hi>ſees,</hi> what <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is</hi> beſt and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the univerſe; and ſo, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to occaſions, <hi>made</hi> and <hi>makes,</hi> or <hi>ſuffered</hi> and <hi>ſuffers</hi> that ſtill to fall out.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) When thoſe we pray for, ſuch as the impure <hi>Sodomites,</hi> have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uncapable of our Charity, yet is our Zeal and Charity to do good, not the <hi>leſs,</hi> but the <hi>more</hi> acceptable in the ſight of God; and returns with the choiceſt of all anſwers into our own boſoms; that is, with an increaſe of the choiceſt Grace; that is, more and more Heavenly-mindedneſs, and more and more publick ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) All labour in vain is not vain labour; that is, labour in vain as to this or that particular deſign, is not vain labour, as to the general aim of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and Religion. No, that many times is moſt attained and promoted, when the other may ſeem quite blaſted and defeated.</p>
